# Analyzing-Historical-Stock-Revenue-Data
Welcome to the Historical Stock Revenue Analysis repository! This repository contains Python code and resources for analyzing historical stock revenue data as part of a Python course assignment.

## Overview

In this project, I explored historical revenue data of various stocks using Python's data analysis and visualization libraries. The analysis includes data cleaning, manipulation, web scraping and visualization techniques to gain insights into the revenue trends of selected stocks over time. The main goal of the assignment was to prove that I not only understand the Python code, but can also use it to collect data.

## Key Features

- **Web Scraping:** Utilized web scraping techniques to gather additional financial data from online sources.
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preprocessing the historical revenue data.
- **Revenue Trend Analysis:** Description of the methods used for analyzing revenue trends.
- **Visualization:** Examples of visualizations created to represent revenue data.
- **Documentation:** Detailed documentation for code usage.
